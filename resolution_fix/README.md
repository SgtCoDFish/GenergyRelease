# Genergy "Resolution Fixed"
The original releases required too high a resolution. These binaries greatly reduce the amount of screen space that's required to actually run the game, and may be usable on a wider range of screens.

However, these binaries were released the day _after_ the 7DRL deadline. The changes made were trivial, but if you're strict about the rules, these versions likely don't count.

## It Doesn't Work!
See the README at the root of this repository for details on what you might need to do. If it still won't work, feel free to raise an issue!
